# Introduction
Modern pages are the default page type for both modern SharePoint sites as for classic SharePoint team sites, hence being able to use CSOM to create modern pages and update them by adding or removing client side web parts is something thatâ€™s very useful SharePoint extensibility scenarios. If you want to learn more about how modern pages are structured then please checkout our [MSDN guidance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/pnp_articles/modern-experience-customizations-customize-pages#programming-modern-pages).
