## Getting started ##

To use this sample you'll need to make 2 small changes to `program.cs`: replace the `siteUrl` and `userName` variables with a site and user from your environment.

```c#
string siteUrl = "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mytestsite";
string userName = "joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com";
```

Once that's done, press F5 to use the sample.
